A collection of my writeups for the "Rookiss" challenges on [pwnable.kr](pwnable.kr).
There are already very good writeups for the "Toddler's bottle" level
but I don't think they are enough of a preparation for beginners
to start cracking harder challenges on their own.
That doesn't mean they shouldn't try though.
On the contrary, always use the writeups as a last resort!
